# cplusplus_workspace

Summary  
This is my practice workspace for my C++ programs  
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
Contents  
The major programs written in this workspace are  

stack.cpp -> Array implementation of a stack  
stackList.cpp -> Linked List implementation of a stack  
queues  
     |__queueArray.cpp -> Array implementation of a queue  
     |__queueLinkedList -> Linked List implementation of a queue  

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
To use these files, simply pick the program you want to run and compile it using your favorite compiler.  
If you are using g++ as your compiler the simplest way to run is to use the following steps  
	g++ <program_name>.cpp  
	./a.out  

This will give you the dashboard of the program in question. Follow the instructions to run the program.
